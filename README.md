# Notes for the project

## Start the project

```bash
npm start
```

## To create a new Component

A component should be as short as possible.

- Go to component directory;
- Create a folder with desired name in Pascal Case;
- The folder must contains:
  - The component file;
  - A index.ts file to import and export the component;
  - [optional] A style.tsx file

## [TBC] To create a new Page

A page file should be a file that only 'wrap' the components
